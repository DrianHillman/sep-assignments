#### 3) What's the Big-O of the following algorithm? Submit your work and reasoning with your solution.
**O(n<sup>2</sup>)** | This algorithm runs atâ€” exponential time. The two `.length.times do` loops compound to give us exponential complexity at O(n<sup>2</sup>). Hence why two dimensional arrays are commonly relied upon as backbone data structures compared to graphs or trees.

#### 6) What's the Big-O of the following algorithm? Submit your work and reasoning with your solution.
**O(n log n)** | This algorithm runs loglinearly. The main portion of the method runs at n but then there's an expensive recursive call at the end which bring us to n log n.
